Acc. Karnik ma'am :
lex abc.l
gcc lex.yy.c
./a.out


Acc Internet :
lex <filename.l>
cc lex.yy.c -lfl
./a.out


Lessons : 
1) Lex in the rules section shows error on one line below where there is 
   an error.
2) There can not be 2 rules with overlapping rules .
3) Only such /* comment */ are allowed . Also put a space before /* 
4) For any token , only action corresponding to only one rule will get
	executed . It's like an if-else_if-else_if thing .
